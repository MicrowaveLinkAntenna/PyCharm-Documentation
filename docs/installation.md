# Installing PyCharm

For COMP1510, we will install PyCharm Professional, not PyCharm Community, in order to have the most poweful version of the IDE with the most features. 

PyCharm Professional supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.

1. Go to [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) and download the installer. The website should automatically detect your operating system. 

2. Go to the folder where the file was downloaded to and click on it to begin installation.
