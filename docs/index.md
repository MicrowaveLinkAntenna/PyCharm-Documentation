# How To Set Up PyCharm for BCIT COMP1510

In COMP1510, you will learn the basics of procedural programming using Python. Labs and exams will require the IDE PyCharm.

There will be three main objectives of this guide:

* Installing Python and PyCharm Professional

* Configuring PyCharm for labs and activating your student license

* Writing your first Python program using PyCharm

This guide is intended for with little to no experience with programming, and in particular first year CST students at BCITâ€™s Downtown Campus (DTC). 

Only basic computer literacy is required to follow this guide. Users will need a Windows, macOS, or Linux computer to use PyCharm. All other software will be installed as part of the guide.

Python is a programming language developed by the Python Software Foundation. Because of its flexibility and simplicity, Python is well-suited for anyone looking to learn programming for the first time. Python is the first programming language CST students will learn at DTC.

PyCharm is an Integrated development environment (IDE) developed by JetBrains studios. An IDE is an application designed for writing, testing, and running computer code. PyCharm is specifically designed for coding in Python. 

PyCharm is just one of many IDEs that users can use to write Python. We have selected PyCharm because it is used in the Programming Fundamentals course (COMP 1510) at BCIT DTC, and the fact that BCIT students (and most other university or college students) are given free access to the premium PyCharm Professional. However, PyCharm boasts a comprehensive suite of features, making it a good choice for any user, and all of the instructions in this guide will also apply to the free PyCharm Community version, with the exception of activating a student license as PyCharm Community does not require activation.
