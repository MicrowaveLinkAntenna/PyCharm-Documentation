| **PyCharm**     | PyCharm is an IDE designed for Python. PyCharm is used in COMP-1510.                                                                                                              
| **Interpreted language** | A programming language where the code itself, in text form, is directly executed by the computer, as opposed to being compiled into a binary format like an exe file. Python is a popular interpreted language, as is JavaScript which runs in your browser and powers websites. |
| **Interpreter** | A program that translates code written in a particular programming language into instructions that the computer runs.                                                                                                                                      |
| **PEP 8**       | Python Enhancement Proposal 8. A style-guide for writing code in Python. Adherence is mandatory for COMP-1510.                                                                                                                                             |

| **Git**         | Git is a free and open-source VCS. It is the most widely used VCS today, and is used in COMP-1510.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **GitHub**      | GitHub is a website which can host projects using git. It is widely used in the software development industry, especially for hosting portfolios. All your projects and labs in COMP-1510 will be hosted on GitHub. This website is also hosted on GitHub! |
| **Installer** | A basic program that's designed to be downloaded and run once in order to install the actual program on the computer. |
| **Terminal** | Also called the command prompt, it is a text-based interface that software developers sometimes use instead of the graphical user interface, as it allows for more precise control of the commands given to the computer. |
| **Current working directory** | The directory that is currently open in a given terminal session. |
| **PATH** | A list of programs that are immediately available in the terminal regardless of the current working directory. |
