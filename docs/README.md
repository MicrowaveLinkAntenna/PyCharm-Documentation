# PyCharm Documentation
This repository hosts the markdown source code for our [PyCharm Setup User Documentation](https://microwavelinkantenna.github.io/PyCharm-Documentation).

This User Documentation walks readers through necessary setup and preparation for COMP-1510 at BCIT. It covers installing Python and Pycharm, configuring PyCharm, and writing a basic program.

The documentation is intended for first-term students at BCIT's Downtown Campus. However, it will be useful to any user interested in starting learning Python.

All documentation written in Markdown using MkDocs and Material for MkDocs.
